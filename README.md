#AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter

## Description
This project aims to create an AirBnB clone, a web application for booking accommodations, with a focus on building a command-line interface (CLI) for managing objects within the application. The CLI allows users to perform various operations such as creating new objects (e.g., users, places), retrieving objects, performing operations on objects (e.g., counting, computing statistics), updating object attributes, and destroying objects.
